# üîê AI Privacy and Data Usage

JazzPracticePro includes optional AI-powered features to help you reflect, plan, and stay inspired. This page explains how your data is used when interacting with AI tools like practice reviews and daily suggestions.

---

## ü§ñ What powers the AI?

JazzPracticePro uses **Google‚Äôs Gemini API** (via `@google/generative-ai`) to provide personalized practice feedback and suggestions. When you request AI help, your practice data is securely sent to Gemini to generate a response ‚Äî **only from your device**.

---

## üì§ What data is sent?

Only the minimum information needed for your request is included:

- Practice activity summaries (dates, durations, notes)
- Repertoire info with learning statuses (tunes marked as ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù, ‚ÄúNeeds Review‚Äù, etc.)
- Short- and long-term goals
- Instrument info (for context)
- Focus area or time available (for daily suggestions)

> JazzPracticePro **never sends your full data unless you explicitly request AI feedback.** You can review what‚Äôs included by visiting your Goals and Activities pages.

---

## üîê How is it sent?

- All AI requests are sent **directly from your device** to Google‚Äôs Gemini API.
- No data is sent unless you click a ‚ÄúGenerate AI Feedback‚Äù button.
- Your data is **never sent to a server or shared externally.**
- The Gemini API key is securely embedded at build time and **not exposed in the app code**.
- Key usage is limited by Google to only the Gemini API and monitored locally.

---

## üö® Does Google keep my data?

Possibly, for a short time.

According to Google's [Gemini API Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms/generative-ai), prompts and responses **may be temporarily stored** by Google for:

- Abuse prevention
- Improving their models (in anonymized form)

If you prefer not to share your data with Gemini, simply avoid using the AI features ‚Äî JazzPracticePro works fully without them.
