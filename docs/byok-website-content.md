# BYOK Website Content Plan

## Summary

**Problem**: BYOK is mentioned ZERO times across jazzpracticepro.com. Users have no way to discover they can get unlimited AI feedback for free.

**Solution**: Add BYOK-focused content to homepage, features, quickstart, and blog. Position BYOK as the primary path to AI features.

# How to Get Free Unlimited AI Practice Feedback

If you've been curious about AI-powered practice feedback but didn't want to pay for a subscription, there's good news: you can get unlimited AI feedback in JazzPracticePro for free.

## The Secret: Bring Your Own API Key

JazzPracticePro supports "BYOK" — Bring Your Own Key. Instead of paying us for AI credits, you connect directly to Google's Gemini AI using your own (free) API key.

**What this means for you:**
- No monthly subscription
- No credit limits
- AI feedback whenever you want it
- Your data stays more private

## What is an API Key?

Think of an API key like a library card. It identifies you to Google's AI service so you can use it. Google gives these out for free, and their free tier is generous enough for most musicians' needs.

## Step-by-Step: Getting Your Free Gemini API Key

### 1. Go to Google AI Studio
Visit [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

### 2. Sign In
Use any Google account (your personal Gmail works fine).

### 3. Create Your Key
Click "Create API Key" → "Create API key in new project"

### 4. Copy the Key
You'll see a long string like `AIzaSyB...`. Copy it.

## Adding Your Key to JazzPracticePro

1. Open JazzPracticePro
2. Tap **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Scroll to **AI Setup (BYOK)**
4. Paste your key
5. Tap **Test & Save**

Done! You can now generate unlimited practice feedback.

## What Kind of Feedback Will You Get?

Once connected, JazzPracticePro's AI can:
- Analyze your practice patterns and suggest improvements
- Review your session notes and offer targeted advice
- Help you build more effective practice routines
- Identify areas where you're making progress (or getting stuck)

## Privacy and Security

Your API key is:
- **Encrypted** with AES-256 on your device
- **Never sent** to JazzPracticePro servers
- **Not included** in backups or data exports
- **Only used** when you actively request AI feedback

This means your key — and your AI usage — stays between you and Google.

## Is the Free Tier Really Enough?

For most musicians practicing daily, yes. Google's free tier allows approximately 60 requests per minute and 1,500 requests per day. Unless you're generating feedback every few seconds, you'll never hit these limits.

## Get Started

1. [Create a free JazzPracticePro account](https://jazzpracticepro.com)
2. Get your [free Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
3. Connect them in Settings → AI Setup

Start getting personalized practice feedback today — no subscription required.
