# Overview

The **AI Feedback Hub** provides intelligent insights and suggestions based on your practice and other learning activities. It helps you reflect on your progress, plan your practice, and get personalized ideas for improvement.

The **AI Feedback Hub** is not intended to replace teachers. We've found that the ideas and responses from AI are useful and generally relevant, but they're not intended to act as a complete tool. Treat the responses as interesting sources of ideas and frankly, a bit of fun!

## How It Works

- The AI runs **entirely on your device** using the Gemini API (client-side)
- Your activity data is **never sent to a server** â€” privacy-first by design
- It analyzes your practice notes, time allocation, and patterns to provide personalized feedback

For more details about privacy and data handling, see our [AI Privacy Policy](ai-privacy).
