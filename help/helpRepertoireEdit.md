# Editing a Repertoire Entry

This page allows you to edit or update a jazz tune in your **Repertoire Library**. You can update the tune’s learning status, practice history, notes, and review intervals — all in one place.

Use this screen to stay organized and intentional about your tune learning journey.

## Tune Name

This is the title of the tune you're working on. You can update the name at any time.

> Tip: Use consistent naming (e.g. “All the Things You Are” instead of “All the Things”)

## Spaced Repetition Tracker

JazzPracticePro uses a spaced repetition system to help you revisit tunes at the right time. Based on your assessed learning status level, the app applies a due date to next practice the tune. The intervals between practice can be changed in the Settings Page. 

### Fields:

- **Date First Practised** – When you first worked on this tune
- **Date Last Practised** – The most recent activity it was included in
- **Next Activity Due** – The next suggested time to revisit this tune

✅ These fields are automatically updated when you log an activity that includes the tune.

---

## Practice Time Tracker

- **Total Time Practised** – This total is based on your logged activities.
- It helps you see which tunes you've really spent time with, and which ones might need more attention.

---

## Deleting a Tune

You can delete a tune if you no longer want it in your repertoire. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.

---

## Tips for Repertoire Management

- Keep notes fresh — they’ll help when tunes cycle back in
- Don't worry about perfection — spaced repetition is about progress, not pressure
- Review “Gig Ready” tunes periodically to keep them sharp
