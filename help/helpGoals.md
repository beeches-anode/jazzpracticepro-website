# Overview

The **Goals page** helps you set, track, and reflect on your musical development objectives. You can outline your playing background, and define both short-term and long-term goals that align with your practice habits, repertoire progress, and personal focus areas.

Whether you're aiming to prepare for a performance, build technique, or learn new repertoire — this is the place to record your thoughts and stay focused.

## Your Playing Background

Use this field to describe your experience level as a jazz player — this helps AI suggestions match your stage of development.  E.g. ‘I’ve been playing jazz saxophone for 2 years. I'm starting to solo more confidently using chord tones in small group settings.’"

You can provide as much detail as you like. If you use the AI features of this app to generate feedback or provide plans, this background information is used to help the AI understand where you are at with your playing. As with all AI tools, the more context you provide the more relevant and useful the responses are likely to be

## Types of Goals

You’ll can create two types of goals:

### 🌱 Long-Term Goals

- Broader or performance-oriented
- Span weeks or months
- Examples:
  - “Learn 10 new tunes over the next 6 months”
  - “Submit an audition recording”

### 🎯 Short-Term Goals

- Usually practice-based
- Designed to be achievable in 1–2 weeks
- Examples:
  - “Transcribe 2 choruses of ‘Donna Lee’”
  - “Practice time feel with metronome on beats 2 and 4”
  - "Increase the speed I can cleanly play major scales to 180 BPM"

The app provides the opportunity to mark goals as completed and over time you can get a sense of what you've achieved this way.
