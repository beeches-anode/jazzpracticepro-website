# Authentication

JazzPracticePro uses magic link sign-in. Your session is scoped to the current app build to avoid conflicts across tabs or deployments.

## Notes

- If you encounter issues, try signing out and back in
- Keep only one active tab during login to avoid confusion
- After login, you can generate AI feedback if you have available credits
