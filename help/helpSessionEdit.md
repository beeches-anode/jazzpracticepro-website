# Creating or Editing a Practice Activity

This page allows you to **log a new practice activity** or **edit an existing one**. It supports all four activity types in JazzPracticePro: Individual, Ensemble, Gig, and Feedback.

Use this screen to track time, make notes, and structure your practice in a way that connects to your long-term development.

---

## Activity Type

Choose one of the following:

- **Individual** – Solo practice using the 7 Pillars structure
- **Ensemble** – Group rehearsals or band activities
- **Gig** – Live performances or informal playing out
- **Lesson** – Lessons, coaching, or critique activities

The form will adapt depending on the activity type.

---

## Instrument

Select the instrument you played during this activity. This is pulled from your profile settings and used for tracking practice habits by instrument.

---

## Date & Start Time

- **Date** – When the session took place
- **Start Time** – Useful for context or future scheduling habits

---

## Time Tracking

### For Individual Activities:

- Time is logged **per pillar** using hours and minutes
- Only entries with both a **description** and **time value** will count
- Time totals are automatically calculated

### For Ensemble, Gig, or Lesson:

- Enter a **single total time**
- Hours and minutes fields appear after selecting the activity type

---

## Notes & Reflection

Each activity includes space for:

- **Activity Notes** – What you worked on, breakthroughs, struggles, etc. When the "Lesson" activity type is selected the notes in this field should contain all the instruction, feedback and advice offered as part of that lesson that you want to capture.

These notes are used by the AI Feedback tool and support long-term reflection, so the more detail you provide the better.

## Practice Pillars (Individual Activities Only)

For Individual activities, you can log time against **Practice Pillars**. 

1. **Sound**
2. **Technique**
3. **Vocabulary**
4. **Time & Rhythm**
5. **Repertoire**
6. **Transcription**
7. **Ensemble Tunes**

Not all of these pillars need to be used all the time, and it is possible to hide pillars and only use a sub-set of these pillars by changing settings accessed via the Settings page.

Each pillar supports multiple entries, each with:

- Description
- Time (hours + minutes)
- Optional notes

You can also:

- Delete entries
- Add fuzzy-matched suggestions based on previous activities

---

## Activity Validation

The app checks for:

- Descriptions with no time
- Time with no description

If incomplete entries are found, you’ll be asked to confirm before saving.

---

## Save, Cancel, and Delete

- **Save** – Stores the activity to your history and updates all relevant data
- **Cancel** – Returns to the activity list without saving changes
- **Delete** – Permanently removes the activity (available only when editing an existing activity)

---

## Tips

- For recurring practice formats, use similar wording in descriptions
- Use the activity notes field to reflect honestly — it powers smarter AI feedback
- Try to log shortly after practicing to keep details fresh
