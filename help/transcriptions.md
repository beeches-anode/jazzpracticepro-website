# Transcriptions

Use the Transcriptions area to keep references to solos and recordings you're studying, and link them to practice entries.

## What You Can Do

- Add a transcription reference with tune name and notes
- Link transcription IDs from the Transcription pillar when logging individual practice
- Include optional YouTube metadata to help you jump back to the source

## Tips

- Keep concise notes about which chorus or timestamps you focused on
- Link exercises in the Transcription pillar so your statistics reflect the work
