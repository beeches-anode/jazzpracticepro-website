# Overview

The **Repertoire Tracking** page helps you stay on top of the jazz tunes you're learning. Each tune is tracked using a spaced repetition system that reminds you when it's time to revisit it, so nothing slips through the cracks.

You can add, edit, delete, and sort tunes from this page.

## Adding a New Tune

Click the **+ Add Tune** button to enter a new tune into your repertoire library. You'll be taken to a form where you can set:

- The tune name
- Its current learning status
- Notes, first/last practiced dates, and more

✅ Once added, the tune will appear on the main tracking list.

## What You See in the List

Each tune in your list displays:

- **Tune Name**
- **Learning Status** (with emoji indicators)
- **Number of activities** it has appeared in
- **Total time practiced** in minutes
- **Overdue status** (days overdue or "On track")

> Tip: Overdue tunes will show first by default so you can focus on what needs attention.

---

## Sorting Options

Use the **Sort By** dropdown to organize your tunes by:

- **Sort by Overdue** – Tunes that are past due based on your review schedule
- **Sort by Name** – A–Z by title
- **Sort by Last Practised** – Most recent at the top
- **Sort by First Practised** – In the order you began working on them
- **Sort by Time Practiced** – Most time spent practising at the top

Sorting helps you focus on the right material at the right time.

## Learning Status Options

Each tune has a status reflecting its current level of mastery. Default spaced‑repetition intervals (days) are listed below and can be changed in Settings.

- **💭 Want to Learn** – Considering or planning to learn (1)
- **🧐 Initial Exploration** – Listening or lightly experimenting (2)
- **🛠 Under Development** – Actively practicing elements (3)
- **🎵 Melody & Changes Learned** – Melody and chord changes learned (5)
- **🧠 Memorised** – The tune is memorized (8)
- **😌 Can play without thinking** – Can play freely without getting lost (13)
- **🎤 Performance Ready** – Ready for performance (21)

The interval indicates when the tune becomes due again. Higher mastery leads to longer review intervals.

## Filtering Options

- **Search tunes** – Type to filter by tune name
- **Hide "No Status"** – Checkbox to hide tunes without a learning status

---

## Overdue Tuning System (Spaced Repetition)

JazzPracticePro tracks when each tune is **due for review** based on spaced repetition logic.

- Every time you practice a tune, the **"Next Activity Due"** date is pushed forward based on its learning status
- The more consistently you practice, the less often the tune will appear in your overdue list
- This helps you **retain fluency** without constantly revisiting the same material

---

## Tips for Effective Repertoire Practice

- Update statuses regularly to reflect your real progress
- Use the notes field to capture ideas, challenges, or breakthroughs
- Review a mix of **new, active, and mastered** tunes in your activities
- Use "Sort by Time Practiced" to see which tunes you've spent the most time on

---

## Want to Edit or Remove a Tune?

Click on a tune to open the **Repertoire Edit Page** where you can:

- Update its status, practice history, or notes
- Delete the tune if you're no longer working on it
