# AI Credits

AI features use credits to manage fair usage and costs.

## How Credits Work

- Before generating: the app checks status and reserves 1 credit
- After success: usage is confirmed
- On failure/timeouts: the credit is refunded

## Notes

- Credit checks happen via secure serverless endpoints
- Your practice content isnâ€™t stored by our servers
- You can continue to use the app without AI at any time
