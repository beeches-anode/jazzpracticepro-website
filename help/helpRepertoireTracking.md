# Overview

The **Repertoire Tracking** page helps you stay on top of the jazz tunes you're learning. Each tune is tracked using a spaced repetition system that reminds you when it's time to revisit it, so nothing slips through the cracks.

You can add, edit, delete, and sort tunes from this page.

## Adding a New Tune

Click the **+ Add Tune** button to enter a new tune into your repertoire library. You'll be taken to a form where you can set:

- The tune name
- Its current learning status
- Notes, first/last practiced dates, and more

✅ Once added, the tune will appear on the main tracking list.

## What You See in the List

Each tune in your list displays:

- **Tune Name**
- **Learning Status** (with emoji indicators)
- **Number of activities** it has appeared in
- **Total time practiced** in minutes
- **Overdue status** (days overdue or "On track")

> Tip: Overdue tunes will show first by default so you can focus on what needs attention.

---

## Sorting Options

Use the **Sort By** dropdown to organize your tunes by:

- **Sort by Overdue** – Tunes that are past due based on your review schedule
- **Sort by Name** – A–Z by title
- **Sort by Last Practised** – Most recent at the top
- **Sort by First Practised** – In the order you began working on them
- **Sort by Time Practiced** – Most time spent practising at the top

Sorting helps you focus on the right material at the right time.

## Learning Status Options

Each tune has a status reflecting its current level of mastery using the list below. The default learning spaced repetition intervals are also shown below. These can be changed in the Settings Page.

- **🧐 Initial Exploration** – Just listening or lightly experimenting (2-day interval)
- **🛠 Under Development** – Actively practicing elements of the tune (3-day interval)
- **🎵 Melody & Changes** – Melody and chord changes learned (5-day interval)
- **🧠 Memorised** – The tune is memorized (8-day interval)
- **😌 Can plan without thinking** – Can play freely without getting lost (13-day interval)
- **🎤 Performance Ready** – Ready for performance (21-day interval)
- **No Status** – No learning status set (no interval) - this is a default setting for tunes that are in the app, but have not been practised or used by the user.

The intervals show how many days JazzPracticePro will wait before suggesting you practice the tune again. Higher mastery levels have longer intervals.

## Filtering Options

- **Search tunes** – Type to filter by tune name
- **Hide "No Status"** – Checkbox to hide tunes without a learning status

---

## Overdue Tuning System (Spaced Repetition)

JazzPracticePro tracks when each tune is **due for review** based on spaced repetition logic.

- Every time you practice a tune, the **"Next Activity Due"** date is pushed forward based on its learning status
- The more consistently you practice, the less often the tune will appear in your overdue list
- This helps you **retain fluency** without constantly revisiting the same material

---

## Tips for Effective Repertoire Practice

- Update statuses regularly to reflect your real progress
- Use the notes field to capture ideas, challenges, or breakthroughs
- Review a mix of **new, active, and mastered** tunes in your activities
- Use "Sort by Time Practiced" to see which tunes you've spent the most time on

---

## Want to Edit or Remove a Tune?

Click on a tune to open the **Repertoire Edit Page** where you can:

- Update its status, practice history, or notes
- Delete the tune if you're no longer working on it
